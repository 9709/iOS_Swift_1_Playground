 ## Protocols
 Protocols are a defined contract or blueprint that a class, struct or enum must follow.

 Here we define a 'ShapeProtocol' where anything that conforms to it must provide a property of number of sides and a function called 'shapeDescription'

 ## Extensions
 Extensions are a way to add additional functions to an existing class, struct or enum.
 \
 For example, I can extend the `'Double'` class to add a function I may use very often such as squaring a number. ie: 4*4 = 16
 
 - Note:
 Extensions are like categories from Objective-C. Unlike Objective-C categories, Swift extensions do not have names.
 */

    // This 'square' function takes its own value and multiples it by itself, then returns the new value
    func square() -> Double {
        
        return self * self
    }
}

var myDoubleValue = 5.0
var mySquaredDoubleValue = myDoubleValue.square()

/*:
 - Experiment:
 Try adding the 'square' function to the `Float` type
 */
//var floatValue: Float = 10.0
//var squaredFloatValue = floatValue.square()
/*:
 We are going to add a few extensions to several classes that you could potentially use for your future projects to make things more convenient.

/*:
 - Callout(Challenge):
 Create an extension on `String` called 'trim'. This will return a `String` that has the whitespace trimmed from the beginning and end. For example: "    hello there  " will return "hellothere"
 */

/*:
 - Callout(Challenge):
 Create an extension on String that checks if an email address has a valid format. You can make the rules as strict or as loose as you'd like. Rules can include verifying there are no spaces, there is a '@' present, etc.

 - Callout(Challenge):
 Create an extension on `Double` to add a function that converts the number of seconds into minutes and another function to hours. ex: Given 900 seconds, the minutes returned will be 15 minutes, and the hours returned would be 0.25 hours.
